1. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to keep the user interface in sync with the URL. In addition, it allows defining which component to display for a specified URL.

2. [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to validate any form's data and make sure that it matches the schemas that define how the data should look and the values expected to conform to them.

3. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) allows users to register and login and get access token to request resources.
